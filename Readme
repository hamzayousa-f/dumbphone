# Dumbphone Launcher — Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2025-01-01

Dumbphone Launcher is a custom Android home screen that provides:
- Digital wellbeing (screen/app usage)
- Optional app limiting
- Notification read/reply (WhatsApp, WhatsApp Business, Signal)

We do not sell or share personal data. All processing is performed locally on your device.

## Data we access (optional)

- Notification access: Read incoming notification title/text to display and provide quick reply. No data is sent off‑device.
- Usage access: Read app usage totals for the Digital Wellbeing screen. No data is sent off‑device.
- Accessibility service (optional): Used to return to Home when a daily limit is reached. Not used to collect personal data.

## Storage

Some on‑device preferences (e.g., pinned apps, wallpaper path, history of notifications for display) may be stored locally in SharedPreferences. You can clear these by uninstalling the app or using the app’s Clear Data.

## Your choices

You can enable/disable Notification access, Usage access, and Accessibility in Android settings at any time. You can also remove Dumbphone as the default Home app at any time.
